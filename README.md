# Hackerstellar-Bootstrap-Paradox

In the year 2050, the population of Earth has reached its peak, and humans have
started to explore other planets for colonization. One such planet, Terra Nova, is
discovered to have abundant natural resources and a favorable environment for
human habitation. However, the colonizers soon realize that they need to manage
their personal finances effectively to sustain their new way of life on the planet.
To address this challenge, a team of hacktronauts need to develop an AI/ML-based
application that helps users manage their personal finances effectively while
promoting sustainable solutions. The application should include features such as
- Budget tracking
- Expense monitoring
- Financial planning tools
- To promote sustainable behavior, the application should make use of an ML
model which gives recommendations based on the spending pattern of the user

It should also encourage sustainable behavior such as reducing energy consumption or
promoting the use of renewable resources.
The application may also leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
provide users with personalized financial advice and support. The app may also
incentivize the sustainable behavior of users
